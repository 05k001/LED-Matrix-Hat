# LED-Matrix-Hat
Code for my LED Matrix Hat
There are two files here for an arduino 8x32 matrix. There is also a processing sketch for converting pictures into hex arrays for mapping onto the matrix.

As of right now. You can load the code onto any arduino uno with an attached 8x32 dotstar matrix and get it to write text or display and 565 hex array as an image.

More documentation to come :)
